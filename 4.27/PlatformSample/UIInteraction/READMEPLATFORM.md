## Description:
This demo demonstrates how to use Pico Unreal Platform SDK to integrate identity/friend list/RTC audio chat services/in app purchase/social interaction/sport multiplayer(session)/leaderboard/achievements/Challenges  for online games.

[Pico Identity & Friend module](https://developer.pico-interactive.com/docs/unreal/en/13156/identity_and_friend_/#application-scenarios) is based on Unreal OnlineSubsystem. Currently, the service provides some basic features, such as getting user accounts and getting friend lists. For more information, refer to Unreal documentation: [Identity Interface](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Online/IdentityInterface/) and [Friends Interface](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Online/FriendsInterface/).

Real-time communications (RTC) technology enables users in the same room to communicate with each other through voice chat.

[The RTC module](https://developer.pico-interactive.com/docs/unreal/en/13156/rtc_service/#basic-concepts) offered by the SDK Platform service uses a centralized communication structure instead of an end-to-end one. After users have joined a room and enabled voice chat, the microphone keeps capturing audio data from users and uploading the data to the RTC server. Then, the server transmits the audio data to each client in the room, and the client broadcasts the audio data received.

[The IAP module](https://developer-global.pico-interactive.com/docs/unreal/en/13156/iap/) By offering extra features or services directly within your app, you can enrich the player experience and monetize your app. The PICO Unreal Integration SDK (hereafter referred to as the SDK) has its IAP module integrating various payment systems such as Credit or Debit Card, Paypal, and Alipay, thereby providing a one-stop and flexible payment solution.

[The Social Interaction module](https://developer-global.pico-interactive.com/docs/unreal/en/13156/ue_social_interaction/) Social Interaction provides players with the ability to invite their friends and to have shared game experiences.

[The Sport module](https://developer-cn.pico-interactive.com/document/ue4) "Pico sports" is a built-in application of Pico VR all-in-one. It is used to collect sports data generated by users when using Pico equipment, including sports duration, sports consumption, application preferences, etc. In addition, users can formulate and manage exercise plans through Pico exercise.

[The DLC module] The platform service of PICO supports downloadable content (DLC). DLC is a special commodity attribute, such as the subsequent expansion package of the game (commonly known as download package). DLC is associated with Add ons products. Each DLC has an independent SKU as its unique identifier. After purchasing an application, users can purchase DLC in the PICO store or in the application, but only download DLC in the application.

[The Multiplayer(Session) module](https://developer-global.pico-interactive.com/docs/unreal/en/13156/multiplayer/) Multiplayer service offers developers with the abilities such as player-to-player networking, matchmaking, room management, and in-room messaging.

[The Leaderboard module](https://developer-global.pico-interactive.com/docs/unreal/en/13156/leaderboard/) By signifying rank among players in a multi-dimensional approach, leaderboards can be a great way to encourage friendly competition while providing an incentive for players to improve and stay engaged in the apps.

[The Achievements module] (https://developer-global.pico-interactive.com/docs/unreal/en/13156/ue_social_interaction/) https://developer-global.pico-interactive.com/docs/unreal/en/13156/ue5_achievements/
